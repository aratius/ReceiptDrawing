Enlarged Receipts

|arbitrarily selected and printed. Upon closer inspection, one can see that the gigantic receipt employs the technique of ASCII art for its depiction. It is positioned in a manner where it hangs from the ceiling, swaying gently in the wind, thereby influencing the space dynamically. This allows viewers to physically grasp the presence of the buyer in a more tangible way.

|Through mechanized methods devoid of subjectivity, these receipts are generated daily. They not only represent human consumer behavior but also become highly abstracted as commodity symbols. The abstract representation of goods takes on different concrete forms when observed objectively by different individuals. Through enumeration, not only the specifics of the items but also the intentions and emotions of the buyer at that time, and even the persona are revealed. This can be perceived as an aesthetic that transcends the practical use of receipts. Moreover, this does not settle uniformly since different subjective interpretations are involved during the human interpretation process, reflecting the diverse imaginative power of humans each time it is viewed.

|From an idealistic standpoint, perceiving others through one's subjectivity merely presents an image mediated through subjective consciousness, and it cannot be said to truly reach the other person. In this work, by intermediating the process through a receipt printer which offers a detached objective procedure, an attempt is made to genuinely reach the other.
